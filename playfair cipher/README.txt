KEY FILE: 
1. key.txt

INPUT FILES:
1. enc_input.txt (For Encryption)
2. dec_input.txt (For Decryption)

OUTPUT FILES:
1. enc_output.txt (For Encryption)
2. dec_output.txt (For Decryption)
Initially both the output files are empty.

Note: Keep all the input files, output files and key file in the same directory as of the source code.

Steps to run the code:
1. Enter the key in "key.txt" file
2. Write the plaintext or ciphertext in the corresponding input files (enc_input or dec_input) for encryption or decryption respectively.
3. Run the program.
4. Enter the required choice for encryption or decryption.
5. Check the result in corresponding output file.

Note: If input file is empty then no output will be written to output file.
