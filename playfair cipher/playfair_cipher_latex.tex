\section{Pseudocode for Playfair Cipher:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 6X6 Key-matrix Generation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write the letters of the key without repetition followed by remaining letters in alphabetical order then followed by digits.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Encryption of the given plain-text:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Make the length of plain-text even by appending "x".
        \item Divide plain-text into pairs of two letters.
        \item If both letters are same in a pair then insert "x" after the first letter.
        \item Now take the key-matrix and the plain-text and encode each of plain-text pair according to the following rules:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If both letters are in same row select the values to the right of both and if at the right-most position, then wrap around.
            \item If both letter are in same column select the values at the bottom of both, and if at the bottom-most position, then wrap around  
            \item Else form a grid as the letter pair as the opposite corners and select values at the opposite end
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Decryption of the given cipher-text:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Divide cipher-text into pairs of two letters and perform the following operations on each pair.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If both letter are in same row select the values to the right of both else wrap around  
            \item If both letter are in same column select the values at the bottom of both else wrap around  
            \item Else take the grid which is formed by the two letters and select values at the opposite end
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
